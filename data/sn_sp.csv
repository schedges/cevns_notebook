#Contains estimates for Sn, Sp for non-even-even nuclei
#Format is Z,A,Sn,Sp

#Gives neutron densities for spin up and down of 1.93 and 1.07. S_N = 1/2 * (1.93 - 1.07) = 0.43
#With isospin symmetry, approximate Sn ~ Sp
3,6,0.43,0.43
#Gives proton spin up density of 1.94, therefor spin down is  3-1.94 = 1.06, so S_p = 1/2(1.94 - 1.06) = 0.44
#Gives neutron spin up and spin down densities of 1.98 and 2.02, so S_n = 1/2 (1.98 - 2.02) = -0.02
